Support for SASS is baked in. To use, import the scss style sheets from `USWDS` and `uswds-vue`;

```scss
@import "~uswds-vue/src/styles/uswds-vue.scss";
```

## Fontawesome

`uswds-vue` makes use of, and includes, the free version of [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/), future versions will include the ability to decouple to decrease the build size.
