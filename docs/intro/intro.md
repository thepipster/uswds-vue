# Introduction

Vue USWDS component library

This is a front end component library whose aim is to develop [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) implementations of the design patterns defined by the [United States Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/). 

The primary goal of this library is to document and provide common UI components that can be included in other projects that adhere to or are based off of the USWDS, removing a significant amount of overhead UI development from such projects.

This library attempts to follow the conventions laid down by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.org/), as these seem entirely sensible!
